  Hello World! Iâ€™m <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manudeo-Singh" target = "_self">Manudeo Singh</a>.
  
  I'm a early career researcher in Earth Sciences. I am interested in Earth Surface Processes in general and floodplain processes in particular. I have been using Optical Remote Sensing, GIS, and Geostatistics as my research tools. I am interested in adding Microwave Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, and Hydrological Modeling as my research tools.
